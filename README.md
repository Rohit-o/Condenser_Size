Here I have developed Condenser (CN) Sizing (S) in Pharmaceutical Industry or Batch Processes Industry (such as Food). Here I have used (Heat Transfer Rate) Q = U(Heat Transfer Coefficient) * A (Heat Transfer Area) * delT_lm * Efficiency as fundamental equation. 
While developing the excel major moto was to find the adequate CNS i.e. Heat Transfer Area (HTA).
On the otherhand, one might think to use all the HTA and provide steam or vapor load according to HTA. 
Trying to use all HTA is not good way as there can be cases in which you have HTA of 15 sq.m. but this much vapor load is not present in the system. In such case it is not good to think that I want to utilize all my HTA.
#In the excel you might need to change U (HTC) based on the MS, graphite or Glass based on the materail of construction (MOC). But neverthless it is always recommended to work between 100 to 170 in kCal/(hr-sq.m.-K)
#It is advisable to check the distillate rate (L/hr) as per the industry practice.
